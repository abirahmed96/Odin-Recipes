<P><h2>Steps</h2></P>

    <ol>

    <li></li>
    <h3>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</h3>

    <li></li>
    <h3>Toss sliced chicken with olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a baking dish. Add smashed garlic.</h3>

    <li></li>
    <h3>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; flip chicken over and continue to cook until no longer pink in the centers, about 8 minutes more.</h3>

    <li></li>
    <h3>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup pasta water.</h3>

    <li></li>
    <h3>Melt butter in a large pan over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms in the butter until all water is released, 7 to 10 minutes. Add ham and minced garlic; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Whisk in cream; add reserved pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached. Add chicken, pasta, and Parmesan and cook until thickened. Serve.</h3>
